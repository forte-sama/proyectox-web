# ProyectoX

ProyectoX is a group of apps created to manage queues at doctors' offices. Composed by two apps (The web app in this repository, and an android app in this [repository](https://github.com/forte-sama/proyectox-movil)), ProyectoX can be used either by the people attending to medical appointments or the doctors as well. 

Regular users can identify their turn number, and estimated time before their turn through the android app.
Doctors and their assistants can manage the queue through a web app, as well as set appointments for certain dates and check statistics about the average time spent in appointments.
